\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

From Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, we learn that the
maximum speed at which any object or information can travel is that of
the speed of light in vacuum, usually denoted as $c$.  Light traveling
in any other medium travels at less than this speed.  Because light
must change speed when it crosses the boundary between materials, rays
of light \textit{refract}, or change direction.  Further, the
refractory properties of materials are different at different
wavelengths; this frequency dependent behavior is known as
\textit{dispersion}.  We will study both behaviors in this lab.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

You learned in PHYS-151 that when a phenomenon is governed by the wave
equation 
\begin{gather*}
  \pderiv[2]{A(x,t)}{t} = v^2 \pderiv[2]{A(x,t)}{x}\ ,
\end{gather*}
the resulting wave trains are governed by a simple law
\begin{gather*}
  v = \lambda f\ ,
\end{gather*}
that is, the speed of wave propagation equals the product of the
frequency and the wavelength.  Einstein argued, and the data has
repeatedly borne out the prediction, that the speed of light in a
vacuum, $c = \unit[299\, 792\, 458]{\nicefrac{m}{s}}$ exactly, is a
universal constant for all observers.  It is also a universal speed
\textit{limit}: nothing can travel faster than light in a vacuum.  But
that doesn't mean that light \textit{always} travels at the speed $c$;
in fact, in different materials, the propagation speed of light, $v$,
is less (sometimes significantly!) than this.  We define the
\textit{index of refraction} of a material as the ratio of $c$ to $v$:
\begin{gather*}
  n = \frac{c}{v}\ ,
\end{gather*}
and these values are always positive\footnote{You can, in fact,
  engineer \textit{metamaterials} with negative indices in certain
  frequency bands; no such materials have ever been found in nature.}
and greater than 1.  The refractive index of vacuum is exactly 1,
while the refractive index of dry air at STP is so close to 1
($1.000\, 293$) as to be indistinguishable in our labs.  Your text
lists the indices for a number of other materials, some with $n>2$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth/3]{figures/refraction}  
  \caption{The definition of the incident and refracted angles.}
  \label{fig:defs}
\end{figure}
The frequency of the wave train is simply the number of cycles per
unit time that wave undergoes, and continuity requires that this value
doesn't change at an interface between materials of different indices.
The consequence is that the \textit{wavelength} of the wave must
change across the boundary, and that can only happen if the wave
changes direction!  Because the different components of the reflected
and refracted waves must add up to the total incoming wave, you can
find a relationship between the angles of the incident and refracted
rays (defined in Figure~\ref{fig:defs})
\begin{gather*}
  \frac{\sin \theta_I}{\sin \theta_R} = \frac{v_I}{v_R}.
\end{gather*}
Rewriting the $v_i$ in terms of the $n_i$ gives
\begin{gather*}
  n_I \sin\theta_I = n_R \sin\theta_R\ ,
\end{gather*}
famously known as \textit{Snell's Law} of refraction.  When light
slows down when crossing a boundary (low to high $n$), the rays bend
towards the normal, and vice versa.  You will use Snell's Law to
determine the speed of light in different materials.

\end{figure}

While the discussion above has repeatedly talked about \textit{the
  index of refraction} of a material, it turns out there really is no
such thing: the index of refraction depends on the frequency of the
light!  That is, we really have to replace relation $v = \lambda f$
with
\begin{gather*}
  v(f) = \lambda f\ .
\end{gather*}
This more complicated relationship is known as a \textit{dispersion
  relation}, and gives rise to frequency dependent refraction known as
dispersion.  While the difference from a constant speed is usually
very small (usually less than a percent across the optical
frequencies, see Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion}), it has a host of very
well known effects, the most interesting of which are the
\textit{chromatic aberration} of camera systems, and the formation of
rainbows (again, see Figure~\ref{fig:dispersion}).  You will also
explore dispersion in this lab.

\section{Procedures}
\label{sec:procedures}

You will receive a number of clear blocks, laser pointers,
protractors, white paper, and tape measures and meter sticks.  You
must use the information below to design and implement a series of
experiments to measure refraction and dispersion in optical systems. 

\subsection{Index of Refraction}
\label{sec:index}

In the first two measurements, you'll be using Snell's Law to
determine the index of refraction of two acrylic objects.  Typically,
these measurements in an undergraduate lab are taken with collimated
white light sources.  Dispersion and divergence, however, complicate
matters.  Instead, we will use monochromatic, non-divergent light
sources: diode based laser pointers; the rays consist of a single
wavelength with a very small beam spread.  You should be able to make
excellent measurements with a modicum of care.

\subsubsection{Acrylic Cube}
\label{sec:cube}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth/2]{figures/slab}
  \caption{The offset distance, $d$, between the original ray and the
    refracted ray after passing through a slab of thickness $t$.}
  \label{fig:cube}
\end{figure}

A ray from a laser will travel across the lab in a straight line.  If
you intersect the beam with a slab with index of refraction $n$ and
parallel sides, the ray that emerges will be parallel to the original
ray, but offset by a distance $d$; see Figure~\ref{fig:cube}.  By
measuring incident angle $\theta_I$ and the offset distance $d$, you
can extract the index of refraction.

Determine how to make this measurement.  You must make a very careful
measurement - the uncertainty of your result is very sensitive to the
uncertainty of your angular measurements.  While you have protractors
available to you, and you should use them to sanity check your
measurements, by themselves they won't give you good enough results.

\subsubsection{Acrylic Prism}
\label{sec:prism}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth/2]{figures/prism}
  \caption{The angle of deviation, $\delta$, for a ray passing through
  a prism.}
  \label{fig:prism}
\end{figure}

The \textit{prism} is a triangular block of dispersive material,
typically used to break a light source with multiple wavelengths into
its constituent parts, much like a diffraction grating.  They are also
used in optical systems (such as cameras and periscopes) to transport
or split images.  Here, you'll use the prism to determine the index of
refraction of the prism material.

Figure~\ref{fig:prism} shows how the path of light is deflected when
passing through the prism.  This deflection angle is called the
\textit{angle of deviation}.  The minimum angle $\delta_\mathrm{min}$
occurs when the incoming and outgoing deflection angles are
equal.\footnote{You could consider proving this\ldots} At this angle,
the index of the prism material is given by
\begin{gather*}
  n = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\Phi+\delta}{2}\right)}
  {\sin\left(\frac{\Phi}{2}\right)}\ ,
\end{gather*}
assuming the prism is in air.

Measure the index of refraction for the prism.  You can certainly use
the minimum angle of deviation method.  Additionally, there is a one
angle measurement that gives the same information.  What is that
method?

\subsection{Dispersion}
\label{sec:dispersion}

Acrylic polymers are well matched to optical transmission, because
their dispersion curves are relatively constant across optical
wavelengths.  Still, with sufficient care, observation of dispersion
is not difficult.  Here, you will receive three different colored
laser pointers and a number of acrylic blocks; devise an experiment to
prove that these different frequencies travel at different speeds
through the acrylic.
