\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To understand the voltage/current phase behavior of RLC circuits
  under applied alternating current voltages,
\item To understand the current amplitude behavior of RLC circuits
  under applied alternating current voltages, and
\item To understand the phenomenon of resonance in RLC circuits.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{The RLC circuit.}
  \label{fig:rlccircuit}
\end{figure}
In previous labs\footnote{\textit{Alternating Current RC Circuits}
  and \textit{Alternating Current RL Circuits}} you studied the
behavior of the RC and RL circuits under alternating applied (or AC)
voltages.  Here, you will study the behavior of a similar circuit
containing series connected capacitor, inductor, and resistor; see
Figure~\ref{fig:rlccircuit}.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

Once again, let's analyze this circuit using Kirchoff's Rules.  As
always, you find
\begin{gather*}
  V_s(t) - V_R(t) - V_L(t) - V_C(t) = 0\ ,
\end{gather*}
leading to a differential equation we have not encountered in these
labs before
\fixme{Fix the DiffEq.}
\begin{gather*}
  \deriv{I(t)}{t} + \frac{R}{L} I(t) = \frac{V_s(t)}{L}\ .
\end{gather*}

We will not solve solve this equation, as the derivation is beyond the
mathematics level of this course; however, in
Appendix~\ref{sec:solutions} we quote some important results.  For a
sinusoidally varying source voltage
\begin{gather*}
  V_s(t) = V_s \cos\omega t\ ,
\end{gather*}
we find the current is again out of phase, but this time, whether the
current lags or leads the applied voltage depends on whether the
inductive or capacitive reactances (both defined as before) dominate
the behavior of the circuit at the driving voltage.  \fixme{Need some
  solutions!}
\begin{gather*}
  I(t) = \\
  V_R(t) = \\
  V_L(t) = \\
  V_C(t) = 
\end{gather*}
where the phase is given by 
\begin{gather*}
  \tan \phi = \frac{X_L - X_C}{R}\ .
\end{gather*}

The circuit impedance is given by
\begin{gather*}
  Z^2 = R^2 + \left(X_L-X_C\right)^2\ ,
\end{gather*}
which has all the same consequences for the voltage amplitudes as it
did for the $RC$ and $RL$ circuits.

\fixme{Need to rethink these }

  \caption{The phase angle as a function of angular frequency is on
    the left, while the voltage amplitudes are displayed on the
    right.  In both cases, the frequency is normalized in units of
    $L/R$.  The phase is normalized to $\pi/2$, while the amplitudes
    are normalized to $V_s$.}
  \label{fig:frequency}
\end{figure}
Just as we did for the RC and RL circuits, we should consider the behavior of
the RLC circuit as a function of frequency \ldots and we're in for
some new surprises.\fixme{What are they?  Talk about Q!  XY mode}  

\section{Procedures}
\label{sec:procedures}

You should receive two multimeters (one of which should be a
BK-5460), an oscilloscope, a function generator, a
decade resistance box, a decade capacitance box, and an inductor.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, select component values for testing.  Select a frequency
  between \unit[300]{Hz} and \unit[600]{Hz}, and a value for $C$
  between $\unit[0.06]{\mu F}$ and $\unit[0.1]{\mu F}$.  Calculate $X
  = \left| X_L-X_C \right|$ and choose a value for $R \approx 1.2 X$.
  Measure and record the values of $R$, the inductor resistance $R'$,
  and $C$.  Record the value of the inductance.
\item Configure the circuit for testing shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:rlccircuit}.  Insert the Simpson multimeter to
  record the AC current.
\item Using the BK Precision meter, record the frequency $f$, and the
  RMS AC voltages across the signal generator $V_s$, the resistor
  $V_R$, the capacitor $V_C$, and the inductor $V_L$.  Are these
  values consistent?
\item \label{item:phase} Measure the phase shift between the current
  and applied voltage for your chosen frequency.  Connect the
  oscilloscope so as to measure the voltage across the resistor and
  signal generator; make sure the negtive inputs share a common
  reference point.  Make sure the two signal baselines are centered
  with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes of the
  oscilloscope, and adjust the voltage and time scales so that
  slightly more than one cycle of both waveforms is visible.  Measure
  the phase shift as you did in the previous lab.  Increase the
  frequency by 50\%, and determine the phase shift again.  Half the
  initial frequency, and repeat.
\item \label{item:resonance} Next, find the resonant frequency.
  First, predict the value.  Then, go searching for it experimentally.
  There are three methods to do this:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the frequency which maximizes the current, 
  \item Find the frequency which eliminates the phase shift in AB
    mode, and
  \item Find the frequency which collapses the XY mode Lissajous
    figure to a line.
  \end{enumerate}
  In an ideal world each method should give the same result, although
  the last method is both easiest and most accurate.  Do they, in
  fact, produce the same result?
\item \label{item:current} Next, map out the amplitude of the current
  response.  Without changing $R$ or $C$, vary the frequency over, say, ten
  points, and record the frequency, RMS voltage $V_s$ and RMS current
  $I$ at those points.  The low frequency should be half the
  resonance, the high frequency should be twice the resonance, and the
  middle point should be at the resonance.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Post-Lab Exercises}

\fixme{need new post-lab exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item From your recorded inductance, and measured resistance,
  capacitance, and frequency, determine the reactance and impedance of
  your circuit.  Make sure to estimate your uncertainties.  Determine
  the impedance experimentally via another method, taking care of the
  uncertaintites.% V_s/I
  Do you get the same results?
\item Estimate the uncertainties on the measured values of $V_s$,
  $V_L$, $V_C$, and $V_R$.  Are these values consistent with each
  other?  Explain what you mean by ``consistent''.
\item Describe qualitatively what happens to your signals when you
  vary the frequency around the resonance.
\item From your measurements in Step~\ref{item:phase} of the
  procedure, determine the phase shift at each of the three measured
  frequencies, including an estimate of the uncertainty.  How do these
  compare to the theoretical predictions? 
\item Are your three measurements of the resonance frequency
  consistent with each other?  With the prediction?
\item Is your data from Step~\ref{item:current} consistent with the
  predictions of theory?  Specifically, do the voltage and current
  amplitudes measured by oscilloscope and by multimeter match, within
  uncertainties, and do they comport with theoretical expectations?
\item Discuss briefly whether you have met the objectives of the lab
  exercises.
